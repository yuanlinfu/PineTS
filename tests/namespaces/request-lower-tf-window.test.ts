/**
 * Regression: request.security_lower_tf used to subtract a flat 30-day
 * buffer from the secondary context's start date. The buffer was lifted
 * from the higher-timeframe `security` path (where it's needed for
 * indicator warmup), but for LOWER-timeframe security the secondary's
 * window is bounded by the chart's own window — every LTF bar that
 * contributes to a chart bar lies inside that chart bar's
 * [openTime, closeTime]. The 30-day buffer caused the secondary to
 * load and iterate ~43,000 extra 1-minute bars before the main loop
 * could advance past bar 0, manifesting as a multi-minute hang on
 * small charts (e.g. 50 bars on 5m running Structural-Leg-Profiler).
 *
 * Fix: drop the buffer, use the chart's earliest openTime directly.
 *
 * This test verifies the bounded data window without going to the
 * network — it uses Mock weekly data with a daily LTF request, then
 * inspects the cached secondary context.
